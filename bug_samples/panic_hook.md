Let's clarify the relationship between panics, panic hooks, and undefined behavior in Rust.

## Panics

- Purpose: A panic!() call is a mechanism for a Rust program to signal a failure condition it cannot recover from. It's a way of saying, "Something went wrong, and I can't guarantee correct behavior from this point on."
- Contract Violation: You can think of panics as a way to enforce contracts (explicit or implicit assumptions) about a program's behavior. When these contracts are broken, panicking prevents the program from continuing in an undefined or unpredictable state.
- Safety: Panics in safe Rust are a defined behavior. The program will unwind the stack, clean up resources, and either terminate or be caught by a panic handler (like a panic hook).

## Panic Hooks

- Customization: Panic hooks allow you to customize how your program responds to a panic. You can log additional information, send an error report, or attempt a graceful shutdown, for example.
- No UB: Panic hooks themselves don't introduce undefined behavior. However, if the code you write within a panic hook is incorrect or violates Rust's safety rules, then that code can potentially lead to UB.

## Panics and Undefined Behavior

- Safe Rust: Panicking within safe Rust code does not cause undefined behavior (UB).
- Unsafe Rust: Panics can potentially lead to undefined behavior in unsafe code if the code is not carefully written to handle the possibility of panics interrupting its assumptions. This is why panic safety is important in unsafe Rust.
- Panics and Undefined Behavior are orthogonal: panic processing might lead to UB in unsafe Rust code but they are otherwise disconnected. A panic hook would never get notified of a UB event such as an access violation /segmentation fault. A panic hook only gets notification if some code in Rust calls panic!().

## Panics and FFI Boundaries:

- FFI-Unwind is UB: Historically, allowing a panic to unwind across an FFI (Foreign Function Interface) boundary (e.g., calling C code from Rust or vice versa) was undefined behavior. This is because different languages have different conventions for handling unwinding and stack frames.
- Recent Changes: Recent updates to Rust have made it so that panics from within extern "C" functions will now abort instead of unwinding, thus preventing UB in this specific case. However, unwinding from other contexts across an FFI boundary is still UB.

## Mitigation Strategies

- catch_unwind: In unsafe code, you can use the catch_unwind function to catch and handle panics, preventing them from propagating and causing UB.
- FFI Safety: Be very cautious when dealing with FFI boundaries. Ensure that any Rust code that interacts with foreign code is designed to handle panics gracefully and prevent them from crossing the boundary unexpectedly.
- Avoiding Panics in Unsafe Code: If possible, try to design your unsafe code to avoid panicking in the first place. Use Result to propagate errors or handle them explicitly.

## Bottom Line

- panic!() is a safe mechanism for signaling unrecoverable errors in Rust.
- Panics themselves do not cause undefined behavior in safe Rust code.
- Panic hooks are a tool for customizing panic behavior and do not introduce undefined behavior on their own.
- Care must be taken when dealing with panics in unsafe code or across FFI boundaries to avoid undefined behavior.
